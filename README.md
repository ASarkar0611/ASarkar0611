## Hi there, I'm Arunita Sarkar!! 👋

♏ Scorpio 🐶 Dog lover ❤️ Reading, Music, Traveling 📺 Horror, Crime, Thriller, Suspense 

🔭 I’m currently working as an Associate Data Analyst @ Cardlytics, Inc.

An experienced and driven data analyst with a passion for transforming messy data into valuable insights and uncovering underlying trends. From the inception of an idea to data collection, manipulation, and presentation, I am well-equipped to support each stage with efficiency and precision. My strengths lie in my problem-solving mindset, and I am motivated by opportunities to make a positive impact.

I began my career as a developer in 2016 at Tata Consultancy Services and gradually transitioned into the world of data analysis. My passion for working with data led me to pursue a Master’s degree with a specialization in Big Data Analytics from Georgia State University. My expertise now spans data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization and data reporting.

Outside of work, I am looking for new adventures and experiences.
Currently, I am learning acrylic painting.
