## Hi there, I'm Arunita Sarkar!! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an Associate Data Analyst @ Cardlytics, Inc.

An experienced and driven data analyst with a passion for transforming messy data into valuable insights and uncovering underlying trends. From the inception of an idea to data collection, manipulation, and presentation, I am well-equipped to support each stage with efficiency and precision. My strengths lie in my problem-solving mindset, and I am motivated by opportunities to make a positive impact.

I began my career as a developer in 2016 at Tata Consultancy Services and gradually transitioned into the world of data analysis. My passion for working with data led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree with a specialization in Big Data Analytics from Georgia State University. My expertise now spans data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization and data reporting.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading books, watching thrillers or horror movies, and traveling. I am always up for a good adventure and am known for my love for dogs.
